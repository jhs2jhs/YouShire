##TODO:

bot.js : is to simulate how users would interact in question creating and replying. It is done on single user version on looply behaviour so far. It needs to extand by simulating multiple users bots interact with each other in a pool. 

user management: 

1. show username in the top banner. create a common method to put req.user into argument when render page. 
2. object_id need to removed as reference, it should just use string instead. 


## DEMOs
